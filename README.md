Using HTML,CSS,JS-
This JavaScript project generates secure, random passwords based on user-specified criteria such as length and character set (including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols). 
The user can choose the desired password complexity, and the app dynamically creates a password that meets those criteria. A simple, responsive user interface (UI) allows users to easily
copy the password to their clipboard. This project demonstrates core JavaScript skills including string manipulation, DOM interaction, and event handling.

Using inbuild method-execCommand
The execCommand method implements multiple different commands. 
Some of them provide access to the clipboard, while others are for editing form inputs,
contenteditable elements or entire documents (when switched to design mode).
